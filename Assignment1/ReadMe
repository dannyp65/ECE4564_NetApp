  In order to capture question from twitter, users have to use correct tweet format and current IP of Server Rpi.
  Please follow steps below:
    Tweet Question Format: @team16_RPI #server_host_addr:port_”question”
    
     Note: '#server_host_addr'is the Server Rpi's IP address (See Server Raspberry Pi below to know how to get IP address)
           ':port' - change it to 50003
           Example: @team16_RPI #192.168.1.32:50003_”What is a Hokie?”

    1. Open command promt and type 'hostname -I' to obtain the Server's IP address for your tweet format
    2. Make sure that all the extra libraries were installed on your Rapsberry Pi (see Extra Libraries)
    3. Run server.py using python 3 (Ex: python3 server.py)
  Client Raspberry Pi:
    1. Make sure that all the extra libraries were installed on your Rapsberry Pi (see Extra Libraries)
