Final Project - JANK Outdoors
Team 16 - Team JANK

Interperter: Python 3.5.x only

Initialize process:
  In order to run the final project, the user must obtain the Server's IP address. The server must be running when the user wishes to proceed.  
    
  Server Raspberry Pi:
    1. Open command prompt and type 'hostname -I' to obtain the Server's IP address 
    2. Make sure that all the extra libraries were installed on your Rapsberry Pi (see Extra Libraries)
    3. Run "JANK_server.py" via the command line on the Raspberry Pi.  
	Note:The server should output that it is running and awaiting a connection from the Client.
    4.  The server can be left running in order for the GUI to request multiple different search parameters.    
    
  GUI Application:
    1. Make sure that all extra libraries are installed on the machine that will be running the GUI.  
    2. Run the client code "JANK_client.py" which opens the GUI.
    3. When the GUI is opened, the user will be prompted to input their activity, city, state, and radius.  
	Note: Due to this being a outdoors application, specific paramters are set in the server code to only produce outdoor results.
    4. The GUI can be used multiple times due to the structure of the application and server.
